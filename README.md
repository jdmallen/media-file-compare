# JDMallen.MediaFileCompare

Short .NET 8 script I use to compare photos and videos between two directories and determine which versions to keep.

I found a bunch of photos in my Google Drive that had already been backed up elsewhere. In most cases, the versions in my Google Drive were the "High Quality" compressed ones, and the ones backed up from my devices could be kept. However, I did occasionally come across better quality ones in GDrive (or originals). It was difficult to discern which ones to keep using just Beyond Compare 4, so I used this script to mark the files I should keep with the Read Only attribute, and did the rest in BC4.
